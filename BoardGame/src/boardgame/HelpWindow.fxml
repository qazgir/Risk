Getting and placing new armies; (Reinforce)&#10;2. Attacking, if you choose to, by rolling the dice; (Attack)&#10;3. Fortifying your position (Fortify)&#10;&#10;Reinforce Phase: You recieve a static amount of armies (3) each turn, but also will earn extra&#10;units if you have total control over a continent.&#10;Attack Phase: You may only attack a territory that’s adjacent (touching) to one of your&#10;own, you must always have at least two armies in the territory you’re attacking from. You &#10;may continue attacking one territory until you have eliminated all armies on it, or you may &#10;shift your attack from one territory to another, attacking each as often as you like and &#10;attacking as many territories as you like during one turn. You, the attacker, will roll &#10;1,2 or 3 red dice: You must have at least one more army in your territory than the number &#10;of dice you roll. The defender will roll either 1 or 2 white dice: To roll 2 dice, he or she&#10;must have at least 2 armies on the territory under attack. The highest rolls and second &#10;highest rolls from each player are compared to their respective partner. If the attacker's is&#10; higher, then the defending players unit is eliminated. No more than two units can be &#10;eliminated in one roll. This process continues until the attacker retreats or defeats all the &#10;armies of the defender, thus moving his/her own units into the now captured territory. &#10;Fortify: No matter what you’ve done on your turn, you may, if you wish, end your turn by &#10;fortifying your position. You are not required to win a battle or even to try an attack to do so. &#10;Some players refer to this as the “free move.” To fortify your position, move as many armies &#10;as you’d like from one (and only one) of your territories into one (and only one) of your &#10;adjacent territories. Remember to move troops towards borders where they can help in an &#10;attack!" AnchorPane.bottomAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.leftAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.rightAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.topAnchor="0.0" />
